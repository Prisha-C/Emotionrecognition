Welcome to the facial_expressions dataset repository!

**Overview**
This repository contains a dataset of various facial expressions utilized for training machine learning algorithms. Created by a group of machine learning graduate students, this dataset aims to facilitate research and development in the field of facial expression recognition.


**Submissions**
We kindly request contributors to refrain from using large image files. For optimal performance and manageability, images should ideally be under 50KB each. Considering that 1000 images at 50KB each amount to approximately 50MB, this guideline ensures efficient handling of the dataset.


**Structure**
The dataset is organized into two main directories:

images: This directory houses raw, unprocessed images.
data: Here, you'll find files pertinent to training, including the legend.csv. This CSV file serves as a key to map each image in the images directory with its corresponding facial expression. Additionally, the legend.csv includes a user ID field, which should be unique to each contributor. This facilitates tracking of file submissions and can potentially aid in secondary analyses to uncover submission patterns.


**Emotions**
The specific emotions included in this dataset are yet to be determined (TBD). As development progresses, details regarding the emotions covered will be updated accordingly.

Thank you for your interest in the facial_expressions dataset repository. We encourage collaboration and welcome contributions from researchers and developers interested in advancing the field of facial expression recognition through machine learning. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
